# The MISSION / QUEST log. Every body you can fly to and survey — every star, planet, and
# moon in SystemDB.bodies() — is its own mission. The objective is always the same simple
# loop the game already has: fly to the body's system, aim at it, hold V to survey it
# (codex.discover) → mission COMPLETE → claim the bounty (G). This file is just the STORY
# and BOUNTY layer over that: a title + a (crude, savage, mostly-true) blurb + a coin reward,
# keyed by the EXACT body name SystemDB/codex use.
#
# Tone: the Survey's mission board is written by a bitter, foul-mouthed dispatcher who hates
# every rock in the sky. The facts are real (nearest-star science, the pop-culture baggage);
# the attitude is not. No story for a body? mission_for() generates a generic one so the log
# never has a hole.
#
# Lookup is by body name so it works for single-star systems (body == star name), the
# authored systems (Sol's planets/moons, Proxima/TRAPPIST/K2-18 worlds) and the Alien zone.

# body name -> { title, story, reward }
