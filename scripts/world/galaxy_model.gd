# The Milky Way as a real textured model (assets/galaxy.glb, CC-BY 4.0 — see CREDITS.md),
# placed as a distant backdrop toward the real Sgr A* direction. Its materials are made
# unshaded + additive so the spiral reads as glowing light in empty space (there are no
# lights out here). Auto-scaled to a target on-sky size so it doesn't matter what units the
# model shipped in. World-fixed (the ship sits at the origin and only rotates).

# keeps its physical size (TARGET_RADIUS), so when its centre reaches you the band wraps 360°
# and you're AT the core. CRUCIAL: we never use the real ~1.6e11-unit distance (float32 would
