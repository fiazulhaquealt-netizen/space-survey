class_name Starfield
extends MeshInstance3D
# Background star field rendered from a BAKED real-catalogue points mesh — one mesh,
# one draw call, even at a million points. The geometry (positions on a 6000-unit shell,
# per-star colour from real B-V (measured, else spectral type), size from V magnitude)
# is built offline by tools/build_starfield.gd, so the game pays ZERO startup cost.
#
# It lives on the world root and never moves: the ship stays at the origin and only
# rotates, so a fixed shell is a correct parallax-free backdrop (stars are effectively
# infinitely far away).
#
# Quality (potato switch):
#   NAKED (~15.6k pts) = real HYG stars an eye can resolve (mag ≤ 7) — the default.
#   TYCHO (~355k pts)  = Tycho-2 mag ≤ 10. Dense; reads as TV snow. Missing first-magnitude stars.
#   HIGH  (~500k pts)  = real HYG + procedural Milky-Way fill — cinematic.
#   LOW   (~118k pts)  = real HYG only, mag ≤ 12 — accurate, still busy.
# All are one draw call; extra faint points cost fragment/overdraw, not draw calls.

# Quality tier — set this to taste / hardware:
#   "naked" = REAL HYG, mag ≤ 7 (~15.6k, includes Sirius) — default. See STARFIELD.md.
#   "tycho" = REAL Tycho-2, brightest ~355,360 (mag ≤ 10). Incomplete on first-magnitude stars.
#   "high"  = real HYG (~118k) + procedural Milky-Way band (~500k total) — cinematic.
#   "low"   = real HYG only (~118k) — accurate, featherweight (potato).
