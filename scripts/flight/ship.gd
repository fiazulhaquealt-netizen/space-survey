# Player ship: loads a swappable GLB/OBJ (see SHIP_MODELS — the Class II cruiser
# is the default), with speed-reactive authored propulsion meshes and arcade 6DOF
# flight. If a .glb can't be loaded it falls back to a primitive fighter so the
# game never breaks. swap_ship() rebuilds the hull at runtime (used when docked).
#
# N.O.V.A.-style feel: simple to fly, momentum that eases to a stop, the hull
# banks into turns. Floating origin means we never move this node — it stays at
# (0,0,0) and only rotates; forward motion accumulates into `true_pos` and the
# world is rendered around it.
