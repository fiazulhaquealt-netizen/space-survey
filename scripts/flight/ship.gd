# Player ship: loads a swappable GLB (see SHIP_MODELS — Lyra by default, Stella
# as an alt) recolored, with a smooth additive booster plume and arcade 6DOF
# flight. If a .glb can't be loaded it falls back to a primitive fighter so the
# game never breaks. swap_ship() rebuilds the hull at runtime (used when docked).
#
# N.O.V.A.-style feel: simple to fly, momentum that eases to a stop, the hull
# banks into turns. Floating origin means we never move this node — it stays at
# (0,0,0) and only rotates; forward motion accumulates into `true_pos` and the
# world is rendered around it.
#
# fly(delta) is called by main.gd (explicit order); mouse look is read in _input.

# ============================ TWEAK ME ============================
# Ships you can fly — swap at the station. First entry is the default (Lyra).
# Per ship:
#   tint   multiplies the model's texture (a wash, not a clean repaint)
#   length auto-fit: longest axis scaled to this many units
#   yaw    facing in degrees — if it flies sideways/backward cycle 0/90/180/270
#   pitch  tip nose up/down if the model imports laid flat
#   glow   hull self-illumination (no scene lights, so the hull lights itself)

	# Combat identity per hull (combat.gd reads hp / bolt_speed / bolt_scale / fire_cd):

	#   Raptor — bruiser: high defence, fast fire, FTL warp form (X).
	#   Vela   — glass cannon: squishy, fast fire like Raptor, the fastest FTL hull.

	# Per-surface roles give glass canopy + silver body + gold accents; neutral dim
